With the following requirements, we quickly pulled together some code that works.

    Stars should have randomized sky positions around the Andromeda galaxy
    Positions should fall within 1 degree of the central location
    Each star should have a unique ID
    The star ID and position should be saved in a csv file to be analyzed by other programs

This code runs without any obvious error, and creates a file called catalog.csv
